/** \class InPlaceGraphFilter
 * \brief Base class for filters that take an graph as input and overwrite 
 *        that graph as the output.
 *
 * InPlaceGraphFilter is the base class for all process objects whose
 * output graph data is constructed by overwriting the input graph
 * data. In other words, the output bulk data is the same block of
 * memory as the input bulk data.  This filter provides the mechanisms
 * for in place graph processing while maintaining general pipeline
 * mechanics. InPlaceGraphFilters use less memory than standard
 * GraphToGraphFilters because the input buffer is reused as the
 * output buffer.  However, this benefit does not come without a cost.
 * Since the filter overwrites its input, the ownership of the bulk
 * data is transitioned from the input data object to the output data
 * object.  When a data object has multiple consumers with one
 * of the consumers being an in place filter, the in place filter
 * effectively destroys the bulk data for the data object. Upstream
 * filters will then have to re-execute to regenerate the data object's
 * bulk data for the remaining consumers.
 *
 * Since an InPlaceGraphFilter reuses the input bulk data memory for the
 * output bulk data memory, the input graph type must match the output
 * graph type.  If the input and output graph types are not identical,
 * the filter reverts to a traditional GraphToGraphFilter behaviour
 * where an output graph is allocated.  In place operation can also be
 * controlled ( when the input and output graph type match ) via the
 * methods InPlaceOn() and InPlaceOff().
 *
 * Subclasses of InPlaceGraphFilter must take extra care in how they
 * manage memory using ( and perhaps overriding ) the implementations of
 * ReleaseInputs() and AllocateOutputs() provided here.
