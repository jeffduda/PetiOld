/** \class itkBoykovMinCutGraphFilter
 * \brief Partitions a graph into two subsets based on the min-cut criterion.
 *
 * \par
 * This class implements the min-cut/max-flow algorithm of Boykov and
 * Kolmogorov given in the reference below.  Given a weighted, directed
 * graph with a source node and a sink node, finding the max-flow
 * through the specified network is equivalent to finding the cut which
 * minimizes the sum of the weights between the two subsets associated
 * with the sink and the source.
 *
 * \par
 * Other max-flow/min-cut algorithms exist such as Goldberg-Tarjan style
 * "push-relabel" methods and Ford-Fulkerson "augmenting paths" methods.
 * Even though these other algorithms have lower theoretical complexity
 * (e.g. O(|E||V|^2) for the Dinic algorithm versus O(|E||V|^2|C|) for
 * the Boykov-Kolmogorov method where |C| is the cost of the minimum cut),
 * the Boykov-Kolmogorov method has been tailored to typical problems in
 * vision making its experimental performance better than other
 * algorithms.
 *
 * \par
 * This class is derived from the InPlaceGraphFilter since the output
 * is simply a labeling of the input (each node is designated to be
 * associated with either the source or the sink terminal.  Also,
 * instead of actually creating the terminal nodes and associated
 * links, memory usage is minimized by maintaing the difference between
 * the terminal link weights as the node weight.
 *
 * \par REFERENCE
 * Y. Boykov and V. Kolmogorov, "An Experimental Comparison of Min-
 * Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Vision,"
 * IEEE-PAMI, 26(9):1124-1137, 2004.
