Introduction -- Petiole is a set of experimental tools for computational
neuroanatomy based on medical images. Petiole provides extensions and 
add-on's to ITK (http://www.itk.org) and ANTS (http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS).

Petiole -- Origin

1) In botany, the petiole is the stalk of a leaf and provides a connection between
the stem and a leaf. Under this metaphor, the "stem" is ITK+ANTS and the leaf
is a desired tool. Specific "leaves" may also require additional open-source
packages such as VTK (http://www.vtk.org) and Boost (http://www.boost.org).

2) In entomology, the petiole provides a connection between segments of the ant.
A common theme among the tools being developed here is using ITK+ANTS to 
implement measures of structural and functional connectivity.

Tools

1) petioleFibers - A tool designed for working with fiber bundles which 
are stored as vtk polylines. The primary purpose of these tools is to use clusters
of streamlines to create geometric models that provide a basis for statistical
analysis. Typically, these streamlines are derived from diffusion tensor MRI
tractography methods. A useful tool for generating the streamlines is the 
Camino toolkit ( http://http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/medic/camino/pmwiki/pmwiki.php )

2) petioleConnectivity - A tool for exploring methods for measuring connectivity. This includes
an emphasis on graph-based methods for measuring structural connectivity.
