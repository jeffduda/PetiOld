Introduction -- Petiole is a set of experimental tools for computational
neuroanatomy based on medical images. Petiole provides extensions and 
add-on's to ITK (http://www.itk.org) and ANTS (http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS).

Petiole -- Origin

1) In botany, the petiole is the stalk of a leaf and provides a connection between
the stem and a leaf. Under this metaphor, the "stem" is ITK+ANTS and the leaf
is a desired tool. Specific "leaves" may also require additional open-source
packages such as VTK (http://www.vtk.org) and Boost (http://www.boost.org).

2) In entomology, the petiole provides a connection between segments of the ant.
A common theme among the tools being developed here is using ITK+ANTS to 
implement measures of structural and functional connectivity.
